title: "About Women Who Code ATX"
---

Women Who Code started as a community group in 2011 when a handful of technologists decided they wanted to change the industry experience for women engineers. Since then, it has become a global non-profit organization and the worldâ€™s largest and most active community dedicated to inspiring women to excel in technology careers. One city at a time, Women Who Code spread around the world, reaching more than 20 countries.

The Austin Network started with a Meetup hosted by a recent bootcamp graduate and has grown into a vibrant community with members in all phases of their technical careers. We have seven regular monthly events, a community slack channel, a twitter presence, and this annual diversity hackathon. We are committed to encouraging minoritized people, supporting new developers, and helping women throughout their careers. Our goal is providing a welcoming space, adding to the pipeline into tech, and supporting those who are currently working in tech whether their background is traditional or not.
