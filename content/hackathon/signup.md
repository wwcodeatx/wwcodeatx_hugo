Join Women Who Code Austin (ATX) for our 6th annual Diversity Hackathon. This is a virtual hackathon, with online workshops.

**When:** Fri, Sep 18, 2020, 9:00 AM – Sun, Sep 20, 2020, 5:00 PM CDT

**Registration:** [sign up here](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/6th-annual-austin-diversity-hackathon-atxdivhack-registration-115101774506)

This hackathon is a celebration of diversity. Anyone who supports diversity is welcome — no matter your level of technical knowledge.

We are providing a virtual space for people of all backgrounds who want to start building their tech portfolio or finish up a tech project while learning new skills. Previous experience in tech is **NOT** required.

Plus, we have a parallel [FREE workshop track](http://wwcodeatx.github.io/hackathon/workshops/) for anyone who wants to come and just start learning, learn more, or meet people.

Once you sign up, we will provide you a link to pitch your hackathon idea/see other people's idea, and slack channel sign up link. [See hackathon judging criteria](http://wwcodeatx.github.io/hackathon/hackathon-rules/).

Not sure what to work on? We encourage participants to look into open data or civic hacking projects, for more information check out [Open Austin](https://www.open-austin.org/about/). Check [past blog posts](https://siliconion.github.io/post/what-to-make-at-atx-diversity-hackathon/) for ideas.
